  "description": "A multi-agent system that researches a target company and posts a structured sales-enablement summary to Slack.",
  "overview": "The 'sales_intelligence_agent' blueprint automates company research for sales teams. Given a target company name, the agent runs a LangGraph pipeline that: (1) uses DuckDuckGo to gather web intelligence about the company — what they do, their products, business model, financials, funding, and recent news; (2) uses Gemini 2.5 Flash to analyse the financial and business model in depth; (3) uses Gemini 2.5 Flash to produce a concise, structured Slack-ready sales brief covering company overview, ideal customer profile, pain points, revenue model, recent news, and sales talking points; and (4) posts the summary to the configured Slack channel via the Slack Bot API. This system is ideal for sales enablement teams who need rapid, AI-generated intelligence on target accounts before outreach.",
